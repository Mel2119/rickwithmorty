        <blockquote class=" flex ml-32 mr-32 justify-center mt-4 font-mono text-black text-lg">Rick and Morty originated as a parody short film by Justin Roiland for a web series. Years later, it was developed into a full-fledged show by Roiland and Dan Harmon, premiering on Adult Swim in 2013.
The series follows mad scientist Rick Sanchez on interdimensional adventures with his anxious grandson Morty. It quickly gained critical acclaim for its dark humor, sci-fi concepts, and unique characters. Rick and Morty has garnered a devoted fan base and has run for six seasons, with more on the way.</blockquote>
